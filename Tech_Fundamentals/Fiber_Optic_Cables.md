# Fiber Optic Cables

Fiber optic cables can transmit data at higher speeds and over larger distances than copper cables.

There are two main types of fiber optic cables:

**Single mode fiber optic cables:** Have a small core diameter (usually 9 microns) and are good for long-distance applications such as telecommunications, cable television, and internet service providers.

**Multi mode fiber optic cables:** Have a larger core diameter (usually from about 50-62.5 microns), and tends to be faster. The downside, however, is that there tends to be more distortion of the light over longer distances, so multi mode fiber optic cables are more suitable for shorter distance transmissions.

## Conclusion

Many, if not most AWS services rely on fiber optic cables for interconnecting the various pieces of infrastructure.
