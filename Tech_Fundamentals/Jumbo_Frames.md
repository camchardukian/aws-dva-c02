# Jumbo Frames

Jumbo frames are a type of Ethernet frame that can transmit data packets with a payload larger than the standard Ethernet _MTU_ (maximum transmission unit) of 1500 bytes.

Typically the maximum size of jumbo frames is between 9,000 and 9,216 bytes.

Using jumbo frames allows us to send more data in a single packet and can thus help us reduce overhead and improve network performance.
